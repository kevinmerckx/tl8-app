      The file you imported was created with the host "{{ wipTargetHost }}". You
      are currently using the host "{{ currentTargetHost$ | async }}" and
      therefore can't import this file.
      <br />
      <br />
      To solve this problem, you can navigate first to
      <strong>{{ wipTargetHost }}</strong> and import the file again.

      <button
        class="btn btn-secondary"
        (click)="navigateToWIPTargetHost(wipTargetHost)"
      >
        Navigate to {{ wipTargetHost }}
      </button>
